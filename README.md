## What is this?

A single API that aggregates anime episode lists and streaming links from multiple providers. Give it an AniList ID, get back everything — episodes, sources, and stream URLs — all in one place.

It's the backbone powering **[Anivexa](https://github.com/walterwhite-69/Anivexa)**, a full anime streaming client built on top of this.

## Note on AnimePahe

When this was last updated, AnimePahe switched from DDoS-Guard to a Cloudflare JS Challenge. The provider code is there but may not work reliably right now. I'll push a fix when I figure out the new bypass — or feel free to contribute one.
